            <h2>"I'm shining, no need to shine for anyone but me!" -PTM</h2>
            <p>Osiyo! My name is Ari (They/She, Two-Spirit). Welcome to my personal page where I share my work, passions, and creative journey. I am a loving partner, mother and grandmother. I take great pride in my Cherokee heritage and embrace the traditions and values it represents. I also have a deep love for all critters, big and small. <br>I’m so glad you’re here!</p>        </div>

            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>I found that my love for design, creation, and problem-solving naturally aligned with the path of Full Stack Web Development. Whether it’s coding a beautiful interface or creating seamless user experiences, building something from the ground up excites me. This passion extends into the work I’m doing with my brand, Renewable Spirit—a sustainable clothing company dedicated to creating both beautiful designs and a sense of community. At Renewable Spirit, inclusivity is key, especially for queer and neurodivergent communities, and we aim to build a space that is not just about fashion, but about empowerment and connection. The brand will feature a blog, TikTok, and more, all promoting sustainability and positive change.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, I’m pursuing a professional degree in environmental sciences, with a focus on conservation biology and ecology. This knowledge is shaping the way I approach both my company and my passion for eco-friendly solutions. Together with a friend and colleague, we’re also working on an eco-friendly travel guide—a project close to my heart that combines my love for the environment with my desire to help others travel more sustainably.</p>
