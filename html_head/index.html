            <h2>"I'm shining, no need to shine for anyone but me!" -PTM</h2>
            <p>Osiyo! My name is Ari (They/She, Two-Spirit). Welcome to my personal page where I share my work, passions, and creative journey. I am a loving partner, mother and grandmother. I take great pride in my Cherokee heritage and embrace the traditions and values it represents. I also have a deep love for all critters, big and small. <br>I’m so glad you’re here!</p>        </div>

        <!-- Second Section Box (with a different color scheme) -->
        <div class="main-content-box second-box">
            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>I found that my love for design, creation, and problem-solving naturally aligned with the path of Full Stack Web Development. Whether it’s coding a beautiful interface or creating seamless user experiences, building something from the ground up excites me. This passion extends into the work I’m doing with my brand, Renewable Spirit—a sustainable clothing company dedicated to creating both beautiful designs and a sense of community. At Renewable Spirit, inclusivity is key, especially for queer and neurodivergent communities, and we aim to build a space that is not just about fashion, but about empowerment and connection. The brand will feature a blog, engaging social media content, and more, all promoting sustainability and positive change.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, I’m pursuing a professional degree in environmental sciences, with a focus on conservation biology and ecology. This knowledge is shaping the way I approach both my company and my passion for eco-friendly solutions. Together with a friend and colleague, we’re also working on an eco-friendly travel guide—a project close to my heart that combines my love for the environment with my desire to help others travel more sustainably.</p>

        <div class="main-content-box third-box">
            <h2>Crafting and Curating</h2>
            <p>In everything I create, whether it's textiles, reclaimed materials, or foraged finds, I find joy in the process. For me, it’s less about the medium and more about the act of creation itself. Sewing is a particular love of mine, and it plays a huge role in both my personal life and my business, Renewable Spirit. Currently, I'm excited to be working on a new line of queer-inclusive ribbon skirts, a project that combines my heritage with my commitment to inclusivity.</p>
            <p>Beyond sewing, I also enjoy random crafting and discovering the creativity of others. This passion for creation extends to my business, where I’m building a community through engaging online platforms—a space where we can connect, share, and celebrate our crafts in a safe, inclusive environment.</p>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <div class="main-content-box fourth-box">
            <h2>Family, Friends, and Furballs</h2>
            <p>Family is the heart of my world—my partner, children, and grandchildren bring endless joy and inspiration to my life. My circle of friends may be small, but the bond we share runs deep, and once you're part of it, you’re considered family. My home is always lively, thanks to a house full of animals, each one bringing its own unique personality and love into our lives. I wouldn’t have it any other way, and every day, I’m grateful for the love and chaos that makes our home so special.</p>

        <div class="main-content-box fifth-box">
            <h2>Adventures and Harmony</h2>
            <p>Traveling is a way of life for my partner, children, and me. We thrive on the open road, exploring new places through road trips and camping adventures. Whether we're enjoying the tranquility of a lake, soaking in the vastness of the ocean, or diving into the energy of a live concert, these moments are our joy. Good food, vibrant art, and the magic of music bring us closer together and fill our lives with inspiration. These shared experiences are where we find connection and create lasting memories.</p>
